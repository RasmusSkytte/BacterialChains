# BacterialChains

This project gives a framework for simulating chains of bacteria being attacked by a phage invasion. The code has been used in the manuscript "On phage adsorption to bacterial chains" by Rasmus Skytte Eriksen, Kim Sneppen and Namiko Mitarai currently available as a preprint on BioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.10.144675).

The scripts assume that 1) you have a connected CUDA device and 2) you are running linux.

To reproduce the data and figures, go to the folder "cpp" and run the following:

make
